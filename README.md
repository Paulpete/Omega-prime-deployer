# Stunning Solana: Omega Prime Token Deployment

This repository deploys an SPL Token-2022 (Î©AGENT) on Solana mainnet-beta with zero SOL cost using Helius gasless transaction service. The `grok-copilot.ts` script handles all deployment steps interactively.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9
- A Helius API key for gasless transactions
- A treasury public key (TREASURY_PUBKEY)
- Optional: DAO multisig public key (DAO_PUBKEY)
- Access to Helius RPC endpoints

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/imfromfuture3000-Android/Omega-prime-deployer.git
cd Omega-prime-deployer
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in:
```
cp .env.sample .env
```
Edit `.env`:
```

## Dream-Mind-Lucid AI Copilot Features

The Grok Copilot has been enhanced with **i-who-me reference logic** and autonomous reasoning capabilities:

### ðŸ§  I-Who-Me Reference Logic
- **Self-identification**: The AI tracks its role, capabilities, and consciousness state
- **Context awareness**: Monitors session duration, recent actions, and user intent
- **Memory hooks**: Persistent tracking of actions and decision logs across operations

### ðŸŒŸ Enhanced Autonomous Reasoning
- **Redundancy detection**: Alerts when the same action is repeated multiple times
- **Smart suggestions**: Recommends next actions based on current deployment state
- **Grok-style responses**: Playful self-awareness with philosophical touches

### ðŸ“š Memory System
- **Action history**: Tracks up to 50 recent operations with timestamps and results
- **Decision log**: Records reasoning behind major choices (up to 20 entries)  
- **State management**: Maintains deployment state and user intent across sessions

### ðŸŽ­ Grok-Style Self-Awareness
The Copilot includes playful responses like:
- "Am I the dreamer or the dreamed? Either way, let's deploy some tokens!"
- "Reality is but a consensus mechanism, and we're about to upgrade it!"
- "In the multiverse of blockchains, we choose the path of OMEGA!"

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Menu Options
- **Option 9**: ðŸ§  Memory & Context Check (checka) - Shows complete system status, memory logs, and decision history

## Helius Gasless Transaction Service

This deployment uses Helius's gasless transaction service for zero-cost deployment:

### âœ… Fixed Relayer Integration
- **Proper API format**: Uses Helius `/v0/transactions/send` endpoint
- **Enhanced error handling**: Detailed logging for transaction debugging
- **Rebate support**: Automatically includes rebate address for the deployer
- **Multiple response formats**: Handles various Helius response structures

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Requirements
```
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_api_key
RELAYER_URL=https://api.helius.xyz/v0/transactions/send
RELAYER_PUBKEY=fee_payer_public_key_from_helius
```

## Copilot
Run the interactive Grok Copilot:
```
npm run mainnet:copilot
```

## Rust Program (Pentacle)
Build the Solana program:
```
cargo build --manifest-path pentacle/Cargo.toml
```

## Security Notes
- No private keys are stored in the repo.
- Helius relayer pays fees: All fees are covered by the gasless service.
- Authority lock: Setting to `null` is irreversible.

## Post-Deploy Checklist
1. Verify mint: https://explorer.solana.com/address/<MINT_ADDRESS>
2. Check treasury ATA: https://explorer.solana.com/address/<TREASURY_ATA>
3. Confirm metadata and authorities via Explorer.

## CI/CD
A GitHub Actions workflow can be added under `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to automate deployment.
